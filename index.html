<!--Hello thinker! Welcome to my Stasis Theory Machine web design tutorial. I'm glad you found it--we're going to use a 2,000 year old formula to come to stasis...just long enough to figure out where you are going. I use this document in my writing classes at the University of Pittsburgh to teach my students a little bit about rhetoric, and a little bit about computer science. Just follow along and with comments like this, and you will make a really cool web documemt.

You could make web presentations the easy way, like I once did: https://spark.adobe.com/page/umUY5ROHgANCl/ , or you can do a little more unconcealing...not just unconcealing who you are, but by opening these tools that you use everyday, these digital/rhetorical tools you might not unferstand, nor know how they function, yet prove so necessary to how you (re)present yourself and connect with others in virtual spaces. And this last bit is an important point! If we really want to be makers, if we really want to be creative, then we need to really understand our tools and how they work. So let's cut it all open--using "tmesis" as the Ancient Greeks would call it--lets "cut" and arrange, tweak, examine, remove and augment...that's how we create!

In this doc., you will work through the four questions of stasis: conjecture, definition, quality, and policy. This method is tried and true, 100% guaranteed to help you understand problems and move towards solutions. Aristotle, Hermagoras, and later Cicero, Quintillian, and Hermogenes added their own iterations.

I like to think about stasis theory in terms of space. Some say the goal of this exercise is stasis, or agreement with the other, but I would argue that the goal os stasis theory is actually movement. Yes, when we come to stasis, we stop. But we stop onlyt long enough to assess how we got where we are and what happened. I argue that we actually use stasis theory to ready ourselves and others to move with changed velocity (in a new direction and perhaps at a different speed.)

 To get started with the Stasis Theory Machine, you will need to fork my repository from GitHub if you haven't already. If you want to easily publish it on GitHub, I'll give you more information at the end of this document. But for right now, fork, and then download the website to a zip file. Go ahead and put these files in a secure place (folder) where you will be able to find them and organize your other assests like images and pdf's, etcetera. You will also need a text editor like "brackets.io" or "notepad-plus-plus.org." Open the style.css and index.html documents in the text editor and we can get started building our stasis theory web document.-->

    <!--If you are working in groups on GitHub, one group member will need to fork the website in GitHub and then each group members should fork from this new repository.-->

<!--BTW. You can leave these faded comments be, or delete them. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--Go ahead and change the title of this HTML document from "Elevator Pitch Generator" to whatever you want--><!--this other stuff below the title does important work to help tell different browsers what this page should look like on different screens-->

<!-- We'll need to do some more work in this section, but to do so, we will need to make some changes on your style.css file. developers refer to this division as a "Hero Block." You don't need to do anything on this html page, but you'll need to change the background image on the style.css page. Place a .jpg or .png in the same file folder (directory) as this project (hint: simplify the name). Add a project name and provide a flashy subtitle-->

     Sign in to GitHub. Create a new repository. Name it. Click “uploading an existing file,” then select/drag and drop all of your files... all of them, index.html. style.css, readme, and your image assets. Click "commit." Now go to your repository "settings." Scroll down to "Pages." Here you will change "source" from "none" to "main" branch. This will publish your webtext online. Copy your URL from this settings page...and now it's time to circulate your webtext! Peace and love only, Stephen Quigley, University of Pittsburgh, 2022.-->
