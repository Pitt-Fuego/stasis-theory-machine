# Stasis Theory Machine

**Hello thinker!**

The stasis theory machine pauses you in space and time so you can figure out your positionality in relation to others. The goal of stasis is not to come to a stop...it's more like hitting the "pause" button...so you can use the code in this machine to think, and ready yourself and others for a change in your velocity (moving in a new direction and perhaps at a different speed in relation to others.) 

## Get Started


1. Go to the the [Stasis Theory Machine](https://github.com/Pitt-Fuego/stasis-theory-machine)

2. Click the green "**Code**" button, then "**Download ZIP**" to your local computer. 

3. Find this folder in your downloads. Move this folder to a secure place. You will return to this folder to manage your files and other assets like images, pdfs, etcetera. 

4. Download and/or open a text editor like [atom.io](https://atom.io) or [notepad-plus-plus.org](notepad-plus-plus.org). 

5. Use the text editor to open the **index.html** documents and **style.css** from your project folder.  

6. Start working with code by reading through the index.html where you'll find instructions on how to build your own webtext! 

7. Once you have modified and added your files to your project file, you will want to publish to the web. GitHub provides a good solution for "free." Create a GitHub account, then create a new repository for this webtext. Click  "**uploading an existing file**" and "**commit**" your file changes to this repository. Remember, you'll need ALL of your assets to make your webtext function properly. 

8. Now go to your repository "**settings**." Scroll down to "**Pages**" and change the setting from "**none**" to "**main**" branch. Hit "**Save**". This will provide you with a published GitHub URL.

9. Test the URL in a browser. Magic, no? Actually, it's computer science.
